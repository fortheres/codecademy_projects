In this project, you will examine how factors such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, and smoking status contribute to medical insurance costs.

You will apply your knowledge of Python control flow to write code that gives people advice on how to lower their medical insurance costs.


def analyze_smoker(smoker_status):
  if smoker_status == 1:
    print("To lower your cost, you should consider quitting smoking.")
  else:
    print("Smoking is not an issue for you")

def analyze_bmi(bmi_value):
  if bmi_value > 30:
    print("Your BMI is in the obese range. To lower your cost, you should significantly lower your BMI at " + str(bmi_value - 25) + " points.")
  elif bmi_value >= 25 and bmi_value <= 30:
    print("Your BMI is in the overweight range. To lower your cost, you should lower your BMI at " + str(bmi_value - 25) + " points.")
  elif bmi_value >= 18.5 and bmi_value < 25:
    print("Your BMI is in a healthy range.")
  else:
    print("Your BMI is in the underweight range. Increasing your BMI will not help lower your cost, but it will help improve your health.")

# Function to estimate insurance cost:
def estimate_insurance_cost(name, age, sex, bmi, num_of_children, smoker):
  estimated_cost = 250*age - 128*sex + 370*bmi + 425*num_of_children + 24000*smoker - 12500
  print(name + "'s Estimated Insurance Cost: " + str(estimated_cost) + " dollars.")
  analyze_smoker(smoker)
  analyze_bmi(bmi)
  return estimated_cost
 
# Estimate Keanu's insurance cost
keanu_insurance_cost = estimate_insurance_cost(name = 'Keanu', age = 29, sex = 1, bmi = 26.2, num_of_children = 3, smoker = 1)

a_insurance_cost = estimate_insurance_cost("Anastasiia", 25, 0, 24, 0, 1)
